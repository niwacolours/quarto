# Authoring collaborative research projects in Quarto

Learn how to develop reproducible and sharable workflows using Quarto and Git. We will take you through how to host collaborative research projects as a formatted (and cool looking) HTML on GitHub. With some easy-to-learn version control and markdown syntax, research outputs can be shared as a live link that is consistent with your latest analyses. One benefit of Quarto is flexibility, accepting multiple programming languages (R, Python, Julia...) and output formats (docx, pdf, html...).

## Requirements TS

The session is designed to be easy to follow; however, it is targeted towards people already familiar with basic coding, code editing software, and version control. We will be using R as an example but Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript are the primary languages Quarto support. R-specific experience is not required.
